# Image Processing Project

## Key Concepts Learned:
- **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**  
  A generative model that learns to encode input data into a latent space and reconstruct it, enabling tasks like image generation and anomaly detection.

- **U-Net**  
  A convolutional neural network architecture designed for image segmentation, particularly useful in medical imaging and other pixel-wise prediction tasks.
